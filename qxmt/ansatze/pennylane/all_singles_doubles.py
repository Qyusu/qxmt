class AllSinglesDoublesAnsatz(BaseVQEAnsatz):
    """All Singles and Doubles (AllSinglesDoubles) ansatz for quantum chemistry.

    The AllSinglesDoubles ansatz is a fundamental variational quantum circuit for quantum chemistry
    calculations that systematically includes all possible single and double excitations from the
    Hartree-Fock reference state. This ansatz is particularly effective for strongly correlated
    molecular systems where both single and double excitations contribute significantly to the
    ground state wavefunction.

    The ansatz constructs a quantum state by applying parameterized excitation operators:

    |ψ⟩ = exp(∑ᵢ θᵢ Tᵢ) |HF⟩

    where Tᵢ represents single and double excitation operators, θᵢ are variational parameters,
    and |HF⟩ is the Hartree-Fock reference state.

    Key features:
    - Includes all chemically relevant single and double excitations
    - Maintains particle number conservation and proper spin symmetry
    - Provides systematic improvement over simpler ansätze like hardware-efficient circuits
    - Well-suited for molecules with moderate correlation effects
    - Computationally efficient compared to higher-order excitations

    The number of parameters scales polynomially with system size, making it tractable for
    near-term quantum devices while providing sufficient flexibility for accurate ground
    state preparation in many molecular systems.

    Args:
        device (BaseDevice): Quantum device for executing the variational circuit.
        hamiltonian (MolecularHamiltonian): Molecular Hamiltonian defining the quantum chemistry
            problem, including information about electrons, orbitals, and molecular geometry.

    Attributes:
        hamiltonian (MolecularHamiltonian): Molecular Hamiltonian for the ansatz.
        wires (range): Qubit indices used in the quantum circuit.
        hf_state (np.ndarray): Hartree-Fock reference state as the initial quantum state.
        singles (list): Indices of all possible single excitations from occupied to virtual orbitals.
        doubles (list): Indices of all possible double excitations from occupied to virtual orbitals.
        n_params (int): Total number of variational parameters (sum of singles and doubles).

    Example:
        >>> from qxmt.hamiltonians.pennylane.molecular import MolecularHamiltonian
        >>> from qxmt.devices import BaseDevice
        >>>
        >>> # Create Hamiltonian and device for H2 molecule
        >>> hamiltonian = MolecularHamiltonian(...)
        >>> device = BaseDevice(...)
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize AllSinglesDoubles ansatz
        >>> ansatz = AllSinglesDoublesAnsatz(device, hamiltonian)
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize parameters (typically small random values)
        >>> params = np.random.normal(0, 0.01, ansatz.n_params)
        >>>
        >>> # Build and execute quantum circuit
        >>> ansatz.circuit(params)

    Note:
        This ansatz is ideal for molecules where single and double excitations dominate the
        correlation energy. For systems requiring higher-order excitations, consider more
        sophisticated ansätze like kUpCCGSD or adaptive approaches.
