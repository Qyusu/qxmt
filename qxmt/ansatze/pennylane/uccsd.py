class UCCSDAnsatz(BaseVQEAnsatz):
    """Unitary Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz for quantum chemistry.

    The UCCSD ansatz is a cornerstone variational quantum circuit for quantum chemistry calculations
    that implements the unitary coupled-cluster approximation with singles and doubles excitations.
    This ansatz provides a quantum analog of the classical coupled-cluster theory, maintaining
    the systematic improvability and chemical accuracy while being suitable for quantum computers.

    The UCCSD ansatz constructs a quantum state through the exponential of anti-Hermitian operators:

    |ψ⟩ = exp(T̂ - T̂†) |HF⟩ = exp(∑ᵢ θᵢ(τᵢ - τᵢ†)) |HF⟩

    where T̂ = T̂₁ + T̂₂ includes single (T̂₁) and double (T̂₂) excitation operators,
    θᵢ are variational parameters, and |HF⟩ is the Hartree-Fock reference state.

    The unitary form ensures:
    - Preservation of quantum state normalization
    - Size-extensivity (energy scales correctly with system size)
    - Exact reproduction of full configuration interaction in complete basis
    - Systematic inclusion of electron correlation effects

    Key features:
    - Gold standard for quantum chemistry ansätze
    - Provides excellent accuracy for weakly to moderately correlated systems
    - Maintains proper fermion antisymmetry and particle number conservation
    - Systematic approach derived from established quantum chemistry theory
    - Serves as a benchmark for other variational ansätze

    The circuit implements Trotter approximation of the unitary exponential, making it
    practical for near-term quantum devices while preserving the essential physics
    of electron correlation.

    Args:
        device (BaseDevice): Quantum device for executing the variational circuit.
        hamiltonian (MolecularHamiltonian): Molecular Hamiltonian defining the quantum chemistry
            problem, containing electron configuration, orbital basis, and molecular geometry.

    Attributes:
        hamiltonian (MolecularHamiltonian): Molecular Hamiltonian for the ansatz.
        wires (range): Qubit indices used in the quantum circuit.
        hf_state (np.ndarray): Hartree-Fock reference state for initialization.
        singles (list): Indices of single excitations from occupied to virtual orbitals.
        doubles (list): Indices of double excitations from occupied to virtual orbitals.
        s_wires (list): Wire indices corresponding to single excitation operations.
        d_wires (list): Wire indices corresponding to double excitation operations.
        n_params (int): Total number of variational parameters.

    Example:
        >>> from qxmt.hamiltonians.pennylane.molecular import MolecularHamiltonian
        >>> from qxmt.devices import BaseDevice
        >>>
        >>> # Create Hamiltonian and device for molecular system
        >>> hamiltonian = MolecularHamiltonian(...)
        >>> device = BaseDevice(...)
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize UCCSD ansatz
        >>> ansatz = UCCSDAnsatz(device, hamiltonian)
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize parameters (typically from classical coupled-cluster)
        >>> params = np.zeros(ansatz.n_params)  # or from CCSD calculation
        >>>
        >>> # Build and execute quantum circuit
        >>> ansatz.circuit(params)

    Note:
        UCCSD is computationally more expensive than simpler ansätze but provides superior
        accuracy for systems where single and double excitations dominate correlation effects.
        For strongly correlated systems, consider adaptive methods or higher-order excitations.

        The parameter initialization can benefit from classical coupled-cluster calculations
        to provide good starting points for the variational optimization.
